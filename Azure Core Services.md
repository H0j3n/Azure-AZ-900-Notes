## Azure Portal Navigation Overview


## Billing Alarm

Use Cost Management alerts to monitor your Azure usage and spending. Cost alerts are automatically generated based when Azure resources are consumed. Alerts show all active cost management and billing alerts together in one place. When your consumption reaches a given threshold, alerts are generated by Cost Management. There are three types of cost alerts: budget alerts, credit alerts, and department spending quota alerts.

* Go to Cost Management & Billing. Then click on Cost Management. After that click Budget and click Add.
* From here input all the details for the budget.
