# Azure Core Services


## Azure Portal Navigation Overview


## Billing Alarm ‚è∞

Use Cost Management alerts to monitor your Azure usage and spending. Cost alerts are automatically generated based when Azure resources are consumed. Alerts show all active cost management and billing alerts together in one place. When your consumption reaches a given threshold, alerts are generated by Cost Management. There are three types of cost alerts: budget alerts, credit alerts, and department spending quota alerts.

* Go to Cost Management & Billing. Then click on Cost Management. After that click Budget and click Add.
* From here input all the details for the budget.


## Azure Virtual Machine (VM)

Virtual Macine are software emulations of physical computers. Represent IaaS and with Azure VMs you don't have to buy and maintain the physical hardware that will run the VM.

**Great Choice When**

* Total Control over the OS
* Run Custom Software
* Development and Testing
* Extend you DataCenter (Hybrid) 

**Type and Sizes in Azure**

* Azure managed disks are block-level storage volumes that are managed by Azure and used with Azure Virtual Machines.
* Managed disks are like physical disk in an on-premiese server but they are virtualized
* With managed disks, all you have to do is specify the size of disk, the disk type and Azure will provision the disk.

## Azure VMs Networking 

Azure Virtual Network (vNETs) are the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure.

* vNETs enable VMs to communicate between them, over the internet and with you on-premises DC.
* Think of your traditional IP network that you need to setup in your organization or your Data Center.

## Azure VMs Availability Options

There are few options that Azure provides to achieve High Availability, Scalability and Redundancy.

**Availability Zones**

* When deploying **highly available, mission-critical apps**, it's a good idea to use Azure Avaiability Zones.
* Availability Zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region, with independent power, network and cooling.

**Availability Sets**

* An availability set is a logical grouping of two or more VMs within a DataCenter that allows Azure to understand how your App is built to provide redundancy and availability.
