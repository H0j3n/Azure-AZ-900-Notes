# Azure Cloud Introduction


## Cloud Computing

* **Cloud computing** is the delivery of computing services which includes servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and intelligence over the Internet **"cloud"** to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale (Microsoft)

* **Cloud computing** really represents renting resources (CPU, RAM, storage) from a cloud provider (Azure) and only "pay as you go"

## Top benefits of Cloud Computing

* Cost
* Speed
* Global Scale
* Productivity
* Performance
* Reliability
* Security
* Elasticity
* Adaptability
* Scalability (Up or Down)
* Pay As You Go

## Types of Cloud Computing

* **Public Cloud**
=> Owned and operated by Microsoft and Computing Resources **(servers, storage)** are delivered through internet
    * Pay-as-you-go pricing
    * No hardware maintenance or updates
    * Elastic, Agile, Highly Scalable and Adaptable
    * Start immediately and go global in minutes 
    * Lower costs
    * Near-unlimited scability
    * High realibility.  
* **Private Cloud**
=> Known as **"traditional on-premises"**, resource are deployed in your on-premises DataCenter (DC), using virtualization and resource management tools such as **VMware, Hyper-V, OpenStack**
    * Full Control over infrastructure (responsible for management and patching)
    * Meet strict security, compliance or legal requirements
    * Accomodate legacy apps
    * Full flexibility over desired configuration
    * Improve security
    * High scalability
* **Hybrid Cloud**
=> Combine **Public** and **Private Clouds**, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
    * Greates flexibility - can run apps both in public and continue to run legacy or sensitive apps on-premises
    * Use on-premises servers in order to meet security, compliance and strict regulations.
    * Continue to run apps on out-of-date hardware or OS, until redesign is possible for running in the cloud
## Type of Cloud Services 

* IaaS
* PaaS
* SaaS
* Serverless
