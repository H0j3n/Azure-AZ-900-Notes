# Azure Cloud Introduction


## Cloud Computing ‚òÅÔ∏è

* **Cloud computing** is the delivery of computing services which includes servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and intelligence over the Internet **"cloud"** to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale (Microsoft)

* **Cloud computing** really represents renting resources (CPU, RAM, storage) from a cloud provider (Azure) and only "pay as you go"

## Top benefits of Cloud Computing üíö

* **Cost Effective** - offers a pay as you go prricing model (consumption-based pricing model)
    * No upfront costs
    * Pay extra for resources only when needed (elasticity)
    * No infrastructure to purchase and manage
* **Scalability (Up or Down)** = Highly scalable and can acommodate any business growth
    * Can adapat to your business by scaling either vertically or horizontally
* **Elasticity** - Highly elastic and can adapt to demand changes, adding or removing resources
* **Current or Always Up to Date** - Always up to date, running on most current and recommend hardware and software versions.
    * Microsoft Azure responsible for Hardware configration
    * Microsoft Azure responsible for Software Patching
    * Microsoft Azure responsible for Software and Hardware Upgrades
    * Microsoft Azure responsible for Replacing faulty equipment
* **Global** - With Azure Cloud you can go glocal in minutes
    * Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks
    * You can provide lower latency and better experience for your customers at minimal cost
* **Security** - Secure, enforcing strict security policies at both physical and digital layers.
    * **Physical security is Azure Cloud's responsibility** - secure Data Centers, Cameras, Locks, specialized security personnel
    * **Digital Security** - Azure provides access to resources in the cloud only to authorized users
* **Reliability** - Highly reliable, providing redundancy and fault tolerance to resources.
    * Azure Cloud Infrastructure is built in order to accomodate disasters
    * If one component fails a backup component will seamlessly take ownership to assure service availability
    * Data in your Azure storage account is replicated to ensure durability and high availability.
* **Speed**
* **Global Scale**
* **Productivity**
* **Performance**
* **Adaptability**
* **Pay As You Go**

## Types of Cloud Computing ‚òÅÔ∏è

* **Public Cloud** - Owned and operated by Microsoft and Computing Resources **(servers, storage)** are delivered through internet
    * Pay-as-you-go pricing
    * No hardware maintenance or updates
    * Elastic, Agile, Highly Scalable and Adaptable
    * Start immediately and go global in minutes 
    * Lower costs
    * Near-unlimited scability
    * High realibility.  
* **Private Cloud** - Known as **"traditional on-premises"**, resource are deployed in your on-premises DataCenter (DC), using virtualization and resource management tools such as **VMware, Hyper-V, OpenStack**
    * Full Control over infrastructure (responsible for management and patching)
    * Meet strict security, compliance or legal requirements
    * Accomodate legacy apps
    * Full flexibility over desired configuration
    * Improve security
    * High scalability
* **Hybrid Cloud** - Combine **Public** and **Private Clouds**, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
    * Greates flexibility - can run apps both in public and continue to run legacy or sensitive apps on-premises
    * Use on-premises servers in order to meet security, compliance and strict regulations.
    * Continue to run apps on out-of-date hardware or OS, until redesign is possible for running in the cloud

## Type of Cloud Services üõ†Ô∏è

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/H0j3n/Azure-AZ-900-Notes/blob/master/img/services.png" alt="My Images"></p>

* **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** - Rent IT Infrastructure - servers and Virtual Machines (VMs), storage, networks, OS from Azure Cloud
    * Provides the highest level of flexibility and management control over the infrastucture
* **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** - Offers an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering and managing software applications.
    * Mostly used by developers
    * Quickly create a web or mobile apps without taking care of the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network, DBs
* **SaaS (Software as a Service)** - A method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis (monthly/yearly)
    * Do not have to think about how the service is maintained
    * Do no have to think how the underlying infrastructure is managed
    * Only need to think about how you will use the App

## CapEX and OpEx

CapEx and OpEx represnet two approaches to how you make an investiment which time and money

* **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)** - refers to the money a company spends towards fixed assets such as the purchase, maintenance, and improvement of buildings, vehicles, equipment or land.
    * Spend money upfront
    * Upfront cost for the company
    * Value reduced over time (tax)

* **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)** - funds that are support your day-to-day business.
    * No upfront cost
    * Pay as you use
    * Same year tax deduction
